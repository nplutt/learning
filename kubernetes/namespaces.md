# Namespaces

Most Kubernetes distros ship with 3 default namespaces:
1. default: Nothing special and can be deleted. Don't use this in large systems.
1. kube-system: Leave this alone
1. kube-public: Not used for much

Create different namespaces to separate your services into manageable chunks.

When deploying a pod the namespace can be specified in two ways:
- `--namespace my-namespace` in kubectl
- namespace specified in yml which will always override any namespace specified in the kubectl command

All kubectl commands are run in the active namespace

`kubens` tool is very nice for managing the current namespace context

## Cross Namespace Communication
It is possible to have one service in a namespace communicate with a service in another namespace.

By using the expanded DNS name: `service-name.svc.cluster.local` -> `service-name.namespace-name.svc.cluster.local`

Namespace communication can be restricted using namespace network policies.

## Organizational Structure
- Less than 10 microservices: one namespace is probably fine
- More than 10 microservices: one namespace per team (maybe)
- More than 100 microservices: more than one namespace per team and maybe more than one cluster

## Namespace Level Resource and Limits 
To prevent teams setting request and limit numbers too high, namespaces can set ResourceQuotas and 
LimitRanges.

ResourceQuotas: After creating Namespaces, you can lock them down using ResourceQuotas. ResourceQuotas are very powerful, 
but letâ€™s just look at how you can use them to restrict CPU and Memory resource usage.
* requests.cpu: the maximum combined CPU requests for all the containers in the Namespace
* requests.memory: the max combined memory requests for all the containers in the Namespace
* limits.cpu: the maximum combined CPU limits for all the containers in the namespace
* limits.memory: the maximum combined memory limits for all the containers in the namespace

LimitRange: You can also create a LimitRange in your Namespace. Unlike a Quota, which looks at the Namespace as a whole, 
a LimitRange applies to an individual container. This can help prevent people from creating super tiny or super large 
containers inside the Namespace.
* default section: sets the default limits for a container in a pod. If a container doesn't explicitly set the limits then
these values will be applied to the container.
* defaultRequest: sets the default requests for a container in a pod
* max section: sets the maximum limits that a container in a pod can set
* min section: sets the minimum limits that a container in a pod can set

## Notes
- Could be nice to have one namespace to make service discovery easier

Isto vs Namespace to make public or private
* One private & one public load balancer 
* Isto may supersede some of the namespace networking options
