=========Introduction==========

Examples of Machine Learning:
- Database mining
  Large datasets from the growth of automation/web.
  E.g., Web click data, medical records, biology, engineering
- Applications can't program by handwritting recognition, most of NLP, and computer vision
- Self-customizing programs
  E.g., Amazon, Netflix product recommendations
- Understanding human learning (brain, real AI)

What is machine learning:
- Author Samuel (1959). Machine learning: Field of study that gives computers the ability to
  learn without being explicitly programmed.
- Tom Mitchell (1998) Well posed learning problem: A computer program is said to learn from
  experience E with respect to some task T and some performance P, if its perfromace
  on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.

Question: Supposed your email program watches which emails you do or do not mark as spam,
          and based on that learns how to better filter spam. What is the task T in this
          setting?
Answer: Classify emails as spam or not spam

Machine Learning Algorithms:
- Supervised learning
- Unsupervised learning

Others: Reinforcement learning, recommender systems.

=========Supervised Learning==========
In supervised learning, we are given a data set and already know what our correct output 
should look like, having the idea that there is a relationship between the input and the output.

Supervised learning problems are categorized into "regression" and "classification" problems. 
In a regression problem, we are trying to predict results within a continuous output, meaning 
that we are trying to map input variables to some continuous function. In a classification 
problem, we are instead trying to predict results in a discrete output. In other words, we are 
trying to map input variables into discrete categories.

Example 1:
Given data about the size of houses on the real estate market, try to predict their price. 
Price as a function of size is a continuous output, so this is a regression problem.

We could turn this example into a classification problem by instead making our output about 
whether the house "sells for more or less than the asking price." Here we are classifying 
the houses based on price into two discrete categories.

Example 2:
(a) Regression - Given a picture of a person, we have to predict their age on the basis of 
    the given picture

(b) Classification - Given a patient with a tumor, we have to predict whether the tumor is 
    malignant or benign.

Question: You're running a company and want to develop learning algorithms to address
          each of two problems.

Problem 1: You have a large inventory of identical items. You want to predict how many
           of these items will sell over the next 3 months.
Problem 2: You'd like software to examine individual customer accounts, and for each
           account decide if it has been hacked/comprimised.

Answer: Treat problem 1 as a regression problem and problem 2 as a classification problem.


=========Unsupervised Learning==========
Unsupervised learning allows us to approach problems with little or no idea what our 
results should look like. We can derive structure from data where we don't necessarily 
know the effect of the variables.

We can derive this structure by clustering the data based on relationships among the variables 
in the data.

With unsupervised learning there is no feedback based on the prediction results.

Example:
Clustering: Take a collection of 1,000,000 different genes, and find a way to automatically 
group these genes into groups that are somehow similar or related by different variables, 
such as lifespan, location, roles, and so on.

Non-clustering: The "Cocktail Party Algorithm", allows you to find structure in a chaotic 
environment. (i.e. identifying individual voices and music from a mesh of sounds at a 
cocktail party).

Example Applications: Organizing computing clusters, social network analysis, market segmentation,
                      astronomical data analysis
